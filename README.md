# Agentic AI Deep Dive

This repository is my learning space for exploring **agentic AI** in depth.  
Iâ€™m experimenting with concepts like:
- Tool usage and handoff between multiple tools
- AI decision-making for when and how to call tools
- Multi-step reasoning and chaining of actions
- Integration of Python functions with LLMs
- Building agents that can perform real-world tasks

The goal is to understand not just how to **call tools from AI**,  
but how to design **intelligent, autonomous workflows**.
